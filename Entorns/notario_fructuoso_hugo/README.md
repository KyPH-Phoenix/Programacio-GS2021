#Asteroids - NeoWs

---

![](./nasa-logo.png)

NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) is a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information. With
NeoWs a user can: search for Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth, lookup a specific
Asteroid with its NASA JPL small body id, as well as browse the overall data-set.

Data-set: All the data is from the NASA JPL Asteroid team.

##Neo - Feed
Retrieve a list of Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth.

``GET https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/feed``

``start_date=START_DATE&end_date=END_DATE&api_key=API_KEY``

###Query Parameters
| Parameter  | Type       | Default                 | Description                         |
|------------|------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| start_date | YYYY-MM-DD | none                    | Starting date for asteroid search   |
| end_date   | YYYY-MM-DD | 7 days after start_date | Ending date for asteroid search     |
| api_key    | string     | DEMO_KEY                | api.nasa.gov key for expanded usage |

###Example query
https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/feed?start_date=2015-09-07&end_date=2015-09-08&api_key=DEMO_KEY

##Authentication
**You do not need to authenticate** in order to explore the NASA data. However, if you will be intensively
using the APIs to, say, support a mobile application, then you should sign up for a 
[NASA developer key](https://api.nasa.gov/#signUp).

###Web Service Rate Limits
Limits are placed on the number of API requests you may make using your API key. Rate limits may vary by
service, but the defaults are:
- Hourly Limit: 1,000 requests per hour

For each API key, these limits are applied across all api.nasa.gov API requests. Exceeding these limits will
lead to your API key being temporarily blocked from making further requests. The block will automatically
be lifted by waiting an hour. If you need higher rate limits, contact us.

###DEMO_KEY Rate Limits
In documentation examples, the special DEMO_KEY api key is used. This API key can be used for initially
exploring APIs prior to signing up, but it has much lower rate limits, so youâ€™re encouraged to signup for
your own API key if you plan to use the API (signup is quick and easy). The rate limits for the DEMO_KEY
are:

- Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour
- Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day

###How Do I See My Current Usage?
Your can check your current rate limit and usage details by inspecting the ``X-RateLimit-Limit`` and ``X-
RateLimit-Remaining`` HTTP headers that are returned on every API response. For example, if an API has
the default hourly limit of 1,000 request, after making 2 requests, you will receive this HTTP header in the
response of the second request:

``X-RateLimit-Remaining: 998``

The hourly counters for your API key reset on a rolling basis.

**Example:** If you made 500 requests at 10:15AM and 500 requests at 10:25AM, your API key would become
temporarily blocked. This temporary block of your API key would cease at 11:15AM, at which point you
could make 500 requests. At 11:25AM, you could then make another 500 requests.

_Anyone can register for an api.nasa.gov key, which can be used to access data across federal agencies._
